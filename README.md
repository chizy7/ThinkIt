## Installation
The first step is to [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/get-started/) for your operating system.

### Installation in Windows
**Step 1** - Assuming you have downloaded and installed the latest Flutter SDK for windows system.

**Step 2** - Unzip the zip archive in a folder, say C:\flutter\

**Step 3** - Update the system path to include flutter bin directory. 

**Step 4** - Flutter provides a tool, flutter doctor to check that all requirement of flutter development is met. 

``` flutter doctor ```

**Step 5** - Running the above command will analyze the system and show its report as shown below 

``` Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[√] Flutter (Channel stable, v1.2.1, on Microsoft Windows [Version
10.0.17134.706], locale en-US)
[√] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version
28.0.3)
[√] Android Studio (version 3.2)
[√] VS Code, 64-bit edition (version 1.29.1)
[!] Connected device
! No devices available
! Doctor found issues in 1 category.
```

The report above says that all development tools are available but the device is not connected. We can fix this by connecting an android device through USB or starting an android emulator. 

**Step 6** - Install the latest Android SDK, if reported by flutter doctor

**Step 7** - Install the latest Android Studio, if reported by flutter doctor

**Step 8** - Start an android emulator or connect a real android device to the system

**Step 9** - Install Flutter and Dart plugin for Android Studio. It provides startup template to create new Flutter application, an option to run and debug Flutter application in the Android studio itself, etc., 

- Open Android Studio.
- Click File → Settings → Plugins.
- Select the Flutter plugin and click Install.
- Click Yes when prompted to install the Dart plugin.
- Restart Android studio. 

### Installing in MacOS

To install Flutter on MacOS, you will have to follow the following steps below.

**Step 1** - Assuming you have installed the latest Flutter SDK for MacOS. 

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
